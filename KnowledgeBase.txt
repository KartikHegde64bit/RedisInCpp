1. Server Socket: A server socket is a network endpoint that listens for incoming connections from clients. It's essentially a "doorway" on a server 
that allows other computers (clients) to connect and communicate with it.

1. AF_INET is an address family that is used to designate the type of addresses that your socket can communicate with (in this case, Internet Protocol v4 
addresses).

KB_1.3
The setsockopt() function allows setting options on the socket. Here, SO_REUSEADDR is being set, which allows the socket to be quickly reused 
after the program restarts. This prevents "Address already in use" errors that can occur if the socket remains in the TIME_WAIT state after the 
program closes.
